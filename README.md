# Surfs Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using SQLite and SQLAlchemy in addition to Python in a Jupyter Notebook. SQLite is a serverless database engine that allows us to quickly setup a database engine without a server. SQLite is stored locally which allows quick testing in comparison to setting up a SQL database server. SQLAlchemy is a Python library that we'll use for querying data and can be used to perform the same query across different SQL dialects. Object Relational Mapper, ORM, is a primary feature of SQL Alchemy. ORM makes it possible to query a database using SQL or Python. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this week's project was to run weather analytics for a potential business opportunity called Surf 'n Shake. The idea of Surf 'n Shake is to serve surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists in Oahu. In order to build a strong business plan for our investors, one of the main concerns we wanted to look into was how temperature could affect the business. We pulled temperature statistics for the months of June and December so we can analyze weather trends. This data will help determine if Surf 'n Shake is sustainable year-round.

## Results
